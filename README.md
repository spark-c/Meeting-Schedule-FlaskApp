Learning project -- creating a webapp for users to register and schedule meetings. Flask+Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, Email

Inspired by a friend's need to have an easy way for their students to schedule times to meet with the instructor.

When hosted on a server, users can navigate to the site, register, and schedule meetings.

TODO:
  Optional user whitelist or registration-by-link-invite
  Automated emails
    Email Validation
    Schedule confirmations
    Meeting reminders
    Auto-reminders to schedule meetings
 (Maybe) Incorporate better HTML/CSS
